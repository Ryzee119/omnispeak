// We now support dirty-rectangle drawing, so there's no need to always
// redraw the whole screen on each frame. You can enable this, though, if you
// prefer (e.g., to have something to compare the dirty-rectangle drawing
// against.)
// (NOTE: You'll need to enable this on double-buffered backends for accuracy
// at the moment, as VL_SyncPages() isn't implemented. The performance hit on
// DOS isn't really worth it, though.)
