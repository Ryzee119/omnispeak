## Omnispeak: An reimplementation of "Commander Keen in Goodbye Galaxy!"

Omnispeak is an open-source reimplementation of Commander Keen episodes 4, 5,
and 6. It aims to be a pixel-perfect, bug-for-bug clone of the original games,
and is compatible with savegames from the DOS version.

This Xbox port is a fork of [https://github.com/sulix/omnispeak/](https://github.com/sulix/omnispeak/). A link to this xbox port is here [https://github.com/Ryzee119/omnispeak](https://github.com/Ryzee119/omnispeak).

## Building

Setup and install nxdk. Refer to `https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk`

Then do this:  
```
export NXDK_DIR=/path/to/nxdk
git clone https://github.com/Ryzee119/omnispeak.git
cd omnispeak
make -f Makefile.nxdk
```
Compiled xbe can be found in `omnispeak/bin/`

**To play, you'll also need to include files from the original game.**
Omnispeak supports:
	- Keen 4 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 5 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 6 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 6 v1.5 EGA

The Steam version and the 3DRealms version contain Keen4 and Keen5 versions 1.4.
Keen 6 is not easily available, infact cannot be purchased legally anywhere. In theory it should work on this Xbox port, but I don't own an original copy of the game so has not been tested.

You'll need to take the following files from your version of Keen, and place them in the `omnispeak/bin/keen_data` folder.  Alternatively place them in `omnispeak/keen_data` before running `make` and they will be copied over automatically and compiled into the xbox .iso.

The CK4/CK5/CK6 extensions are required if you want to play Keen 4, 5 or 6 respectively
```
GAMEMAPS.CK4 / GAMEMAPS.CK5 / GAMEMAPS.CK6
EGAGRAPH.CK4 / EGAGRAPH.CK5 / EGAGRAPH.CK6
AUDIO.CK4 / AUDIO.CK4 / AUDIO.CK6
```
