Omnispeak: An reimplementation of "Commander Keen in Goodbye Galaxy!"

Omnispeak is an open-source reimplementation of Commander Keen episodes 4, 5,
and 6. It aims to be a pixel-perfect, bug-for-bug clone of the original games,
and is compatible with savegames from the DOS version.

Omnispeak's homepage, including binary downloads, is available at:
	https://davidgow.net/keen/omnispeak.html

== INSTALLATION ==
To play, you'll need to include files from the original game.

Omnispeak supports:
	- Keen 4 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 5 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 6 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 6 v1.5 EGA

These should be the easiest versions to get. For example, the Steam version and
the 3DRealms version are both version 1.4. Keen 6 is not easily available, but
you should be able to find patches which convert one version of the game to
another. Keen 6 v1.5 fixes a few bugs, so it's probably best to use it if you
can.

The shareware release of Keen 4 v1.4 is available here:
	https://davidgow.net/keen/4keen14.zip


You'll need to take the following files from your version of Keen, and place
them in the same directory as the 'omnispeak' binary:
	* GAMEMAPS.CK?
	* EGAGRAPH.CK?
	* AUDIO.CK?

You'll also need the files from the 'data' directory corresponding to your
version of Keen. 

== COMPILING ==
Setup and install nxdk (https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk) then:
make -f Makefile.nxdk NXDK_DIR=/path/to/nxdk

You will need the put the game files in the keen_data folder. The data structure should look like this:

default.xbe
LICENSE.txt
keen_data/
--AUDIO.CK4/CK5/Ck6
--EGAGRAPH.CK4/CK5/Ck6
--GAMEMAPS.CK4/CK5/Ck6
omnispeak_data/
--ACTION.CK4
--etc.
xbox/
--TitleImage.xbx
--TitleImage.jpg

== KNOWN ISSUES ==

- Mouse support is not implemented.
- Some debug cheats are not supported.
- New settings ("Fullscreen", "Aspect Ratio", "Overscan border") are not saved.
